# TEST PLAN

### Test Summary
In this release, QA would be testing the prototype for the new bookshelf app. It's a web app so testing would be done across Chrome & Firefox, Windows and MAC OS. An exploratory test would be carried out across the web application as it requires minimal planning and has a faster turn around

### In Scope Tickets

1. The index route should render the list of books and an Add Book button. 
2. The Add Book button should bring up a form to add a new book.
3. The form should have 4 fields, "title", "author", "description", and "imageUrl" 
4. Submitting the form should add a new book to the database 
5. Use the design file and try your best to match it 

### Out of Scope Tickets

1. Nil

### Test Levels

|**Level**|**Included**|
| --- | --- | 
| Tickets | No |
| Smoke Test | No |
| Exploratory Test | Yes |
| Full Regression | No |

### Test Approach
Multiple cycle of manual testing (depending on test result) against new functionality plus automated regression testing against high-risk areas. We will run 100% of tests during the first cycle, flushing out defects. Defects will be reported as identified. A second test cycle will begin when severity 1/2 defects have been fixed and deployed to the test environment. Defect fixes will be verified ahead of scripted tests and if the fixes are unsuccessful, the second cycle of testing will be halted until their redevelopment and deployment to test. On confirmed success of defect fixes, we will run 100% of our tests in priority order. If additional severity 1 / 2 defects are identified, then it will be necessary to repeat this in further cycles of testing. If no severity 1 / 2 defects are identified during the first test cycle, we will have no second. 

### Entry Criteria
|**Entry No**|**Criteria**|
| --- | --- | 
| Entry 1  | Changes available and deployed to test environment |
| Entry 2  | Test cases scripted and ready  |
| Entry 3  | Test plan approved by Product Owner   |
| Entry 4  | Test cases approved by Product Owner   |

### Exit Criteria
|**Exit No**|**Criteria**|
| --- | --- | 
| Exit 1  | All test cases executed  |
| Exit 2  | Pass rate is 80% +   |
| Exit 3  | All severity 1 / 2 defects fixed, retested and closed    |
| Exit 4  | All severity 3 / 4 defects reviewed by Product Owner    |

### Test Suspension
Possible reasons for test suspension are change requests, high-volume defects, unsuccessful defect fixes in cycle 2+, 40% test failure, environment failure and resources unavailability.
